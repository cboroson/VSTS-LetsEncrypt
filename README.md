# Write Secrets

Generate LetsEncrypt signed certificates and upload as secrets to Key Vault.
NOTE:  This extension is not affiliated with LetsEncrypt or the EFF.

## Getting Started
As of this writing, automated certificate generation is possible using Azure's Key Vault and two, public certificate authorities.  However, integration with the Electronic Frontier Foundation's LetsEncrypt certificate authority is not yet available or planned.  This extension fills that gap by enabling the acquisition of signed certificates from LetsEncrypt and uploading them to an Azure Key Vault.

This extension is merely a front end for portions of Ryan's Bolger's Posh-ACME module (https://github.com/rmbolger/Posh-ACME).  It is intended to be part of a task group where a certificate is requested, stored in Key Vault and subsequent tasks or builds download the key/cert from Key Vault.  Toward that end, the extension supports tagging the Key Vault secret so that other tasks can identify the certificate.  Tagging is also useful to identify where the certificate is installed to add visibily and tracking information for renewals.

Since this extension requires a custom Powershell module, it is intended to run on private (not hosted) VSTS agents.  There may be ways of installing the Posh-ACME module in a user context to enable using hosted agent, but that was beyond the scope of this exercise.

Also, since there's no guarantee that this extension will always run on the same VSTS agent, it does not make sense to maintain a local history of each request.  Doing so would keep certificates in a local users appdata folder, which is harder to secure and maintain than storing them in Key Vault.  Therefore, this extension sets the $env:LOCALAPPDATA variable to the VSTS variable BUILD_STAGINGDIRECTORY.  This ensures that all certificates, requests, keys, etc. are deleted at the end of each build.


### Key Vault integration
Presently, some ARM templates are unable to integrate seamlessly with Azure's Key Vault.  Perhaps this is just my experience, but I've seen that some ARM templates are able to query Key Vault for a certificate (i.e. NOT a secret), while others require a pfx file.  I've found that Powershell works well as an intermediary to make certificate management more consistent across resource types.  Therefore, this extension offers several options on how to store the certificate in Key Vault.  It can store certificates as base64-encoded, password-protected secrets, or as keys, or as certificates.  There are other VSTS extensions that can retrieve and decrypt these secrets for use in VSTS tasks. 

### Prerequisites
This extension requires Ryan Bolger's Posh-ACME module https://github.com/rmbolger/Posh-ACME.  This extension has been tested with version 2.0.1 of this module.
